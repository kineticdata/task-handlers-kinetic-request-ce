== Details

Returns information about the submission found by the query given plus limit=1.
Note that the query should be specific enough to bring back just one value. If it
is not, one will be selected by the system because of the limit=1 added onto the
search. The first one returned will be returned by the handler.

Note that the query must be URI escaped. This can be done by using
URI.escape in the parameter. For example:
<%=URI.escape("values[Notification Name]")%>=<%=URI.escape(@inputs['Email Template Name'])%>&value[Type]=Recipient
In this example, the first field name must be escaped because of the space, and the variable should
because it is unknown what characters that may contain. We *don't* want to escape the & because we want that
to act like a & on the URL and then the rest of the field and values don't contain anything we need to escape.
