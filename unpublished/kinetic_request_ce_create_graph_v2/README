=== Detailed Description
This handler create a graph with the provided data and create a file to be
added as an attachment and uploads it to a Kinetic Request
CE form. The file is created using the Filename and File Content input parameters
and is then passed to the specified form using the Content Type of text/plain.
If the file is successfully uploaded, the handler will return a JSON file string
that will be most likely used in conjunction with the Kinetic Request CE 
Submission Create handler. The JSON Files response should be passed directly to
the Sumbission Create call as a part of the values object for the attachment 
question on the form. An example of using this handlers result is below (where 
"Attach File" is the label for the attachment field on the form).

{"Attach File" : <%=@results['kinetic_request_ce_create_attachment_v1']['Files']%>}

If used to put the info into an answer, it looks something like this:

data:image/jpg;base64,/*base64-data-string here*/

This can be included as an in-line image in an email like this:
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64,/*base64-data-string here*/" />

Or can be added as a downloadable image on a link like this:
<a id='link' download='chart.png'>Save as Image</a>
with this as an on-load event (with fieldname replaced with the correct fieldname):
 $('#link').attr('href', values(fieldname));
 
Or it can similarly be added inline to the service item like this:
<img id="chartimg" src="" />
with this as an on-load event (with fieldname replaced with the correct fieldname):
 $('#chartimg').attr('src', values(fieldname));
