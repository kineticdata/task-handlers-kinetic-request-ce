== Details

Returns information about the submissions found by the query given,
the count, and XML list of the Ids (for looping through the submissions),
jsons of the submissions, and an XML of the submission (in case you want
to loop through something other than the id.

Note that the query must be URI escaped. This can be done by using 
URI.escape in the parameter. For example:
<%=URI.escape("values[Notification Name]")%>=<%=URI.escape(@inputs['Email Template Name'])%>&value[Type]=Recipient
In this example, the first field name must be escaped because of the space, and the variable should 
because it is unknown what characters that may contain. We *don't* want to escape the & because we want that
to act like a & on the URL and then the rest of the field and values don't contain anything we need to escape.
